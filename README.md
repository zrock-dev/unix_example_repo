# dummy-static-website

Just clone the repo in your website's intended root direcotry and you're good to go.



This sample website was created for people who need to test Apache, Nginx, Litespeed, Varnish, Squid or any file-serving application and don't have time to create a website everytime

There is three pages with images (cats, apparently most common pictures on internet except for some you could not view at work, landscapes and video games). Two of them are png, the rest are jpg (I did not bother with gif since it doesn't seem used anymore).

There are also the common files in a website, such as robots.txt, favicon.ico, etc.

I'm not a designer so the website looks like crap. Don't hesitate to ask for commit rights to improve or make it prettier. 

I created this dummy website from a template (yes, I was lazy even for that :) ) that you can get there : https://html5boilerplate.com/
